                    В высокогорьях и святых местах, там, где дует сильный ветер, тибетцы зовут:
                    «Сососо!», «Ла Сосо!», «Кики Сосо!». Эти мантры призывают объединиться силу
                    земли и неба, духа.

                        </strong>
                        represents a unique vision of the artist's creative path based on a detailed
                        personal Road Map.
                        The 'Artist's Development Roadmap' is a written action guide that includes a
                        detailed outline for the Artist's next steps such as creative activity, image
                        details, brand
                        strategy description, interactions with the public, execution-style, marketing

                        collaborations business meetings –all this requires strength, specialized
                        knowledge, and time. Even with outstanding talent, without the right approach,
                        Olympus remains unconquered for many. Questions of 'where to go', 'whom to
                        contact', 'how to negotiate and what' can bog down an artist before any debut.
                        These are the questions our services can answer and facilitate, with numerous
                        years of experience, we know how to present each artist in an individualistic way that
                        reveals their distinctive expressive flair.</p>

                        to improve and transform it into a successful product with maximum profits. If
                        the Artist is at the beginning of their formation, we will plan all stages of their path from
                        brand development, promotion, consulting, legal, to the signing of contracts

                        our legal team helps authors, creators, artists to deal with the tough world of
                        modern business. Each piece of artwork, even a digital,requires intellectual
                        property rights registration in order to protect the owner. Further comes the question of how to
                        regulate the relations with galleries, art dealers, agents and record companies
                        without facing fraud.Making money, even in the Art sphere, has plenty of legal nuances, which should
                        be covered by a perfectly made contract. Roya lties, art sales, how many taxes
                        should be paid and why, how to create a company for further activity -are just a small
                        part of the questions connected with the art creation process, and frankly
                        speaking, most of these issues are hidden from the Artist's everyday life. We handle all legal
                        nuances related to the art industry, aiming to keep the Artist safe on their
                        adventurous walk to Olympus.</span></p>
